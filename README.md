# QuEST_jl
#### Julia wrapper for the Quantum Exact Simulation Toolkit (QuEST)

This package makes available the high-performance quantum circuit
simulator as a package in the the Matlab-like rapid-prototyping
scientific computing language [Julia](https://julialang.org/).

### Note on Clang.jl

We are currently using Clang.jl to automatically create the Julia code matching the C data structures. The current version 0.12.1 of the *real* [Clang.jl](https://github.com/JuliaInterop/Clang.jl) doesn't work with the current Julia 1.6 and appears to be in a longer process of changing stuff. For that reason, we made a copy of Clang.jl here: [github.com/TartuQC/Clang.jl](https://github.com/TartuQC/Clang.jl) which differs from the original only in the UUID and in requiring the current Julia 1.6.

Because of that, some shit is necessary to make stuff work.  Contributors are welcome to
1. Make Clang.jl work (with Julia 1.6), *or*
2. Move QuEST_jl from Clang.jl to BinaryBuilder.

##### Here's what you have to do:
*Don't* do `pkg> add` QuEST_jl. Instead do the following two steps in this order:
1. `(@v1.6) pkg> add https://github.com/fieldofnodes/QuEST_jl`
2. `(@v1.6) pkg> add https://github.com/fieldofnodes/QuEST_jl.git`

## Installation

There are two ways to build Quest_jl, depending on whether you want to tune QuEST to your hardware or are happy with the QuEST default make process.

**Expert build** is intended for people who want to tune their QuEST installation to their hardware.
An expert must download and build QuEST himself, and make it compatible with the QuEST_jl expert-build process, see below.

**Non-expert build** is intended for people who are happy with the default QuEST build, but want to QuEST_jl to work out of the box.

### Building QuEST_jl as non-expert

The non-expert build clones a copy of QuEST from our fork, [TartuQC/QuEST](https://github.com/TartuQC/QuEST), which it then automatically compiles using make and C-compiler and whatnot -- you don't want to know.

You do, however, need to have the necessary software on your system.

##### Software requirements on Linux
* Git
* Julia 1.5.4 (currently,
  [Clang.jl](https://github.com/JuliaInterop/Clang.jl) does not work
  with Julia 1.6)
* build-essential (or the equivalent in your Linux distribution)
* CMAKE

##### Software requirements on MacOS
* xcode
* Julia 1.6 (from homebrew) with the hack above to get around the Clang.jl problem.

##### Software requirements on Windows 10

*We cannot make the Windows build work right now, as we don't know how to make make make a `.dll` file; see [issue # 10](https://github.com/TartuQC/QuEST_jl/issues/10).

* Git
* Julia 1.5.4 (currently,
  [Clang.jl](https://github.com/JuliaInterop/Clang.jl) does not work
  with Julia 1.6)
* [CMAKE](https://cmake.org/download/) (added to path)
* [make](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/make) through [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install) package manager
* MSYS with `mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc` and `mingw-w64-x86_64-make` (add
  `msys64/mingw64/bin` to
  path). [Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXF4A5UeSeM)
* You may need to start Julia from the Git Bash console.


#### Building instructions

Download and build the Julia package like this:

```{julia}
] add QuEST_jl
```

QuEST is automatically cloned from GitHub (from this fork:
https://github.com/Ketita/QuEST) to your Julia packages folder, and
built in two versions, one for 32-bit precision and one for 64-bit
precision.

After that, just use it!  Whenever you use it, you have to decide which
"QuEST precision" you want: wither `Qreal` is 32-bit (Float32) or
64-bit (Float64).  The two variants are in different sub-modules of
QuEST_jl.  For example, to use 32-bit precision, just do this:

```{julia}
using QuEST_jl
const QuEST = QuEST32
qenv = QuEST.createQuESTenv()
```

The QuEST dynamic libary is loaded when you create your (first) QuEST
environment.  In order to switch to another precision, you have to
terminate Julia, and start it again.

### Building QuEST_jl as "expert"

To activate "expert" mode, before building the QuEST_jl package, you have to set the environment variable
```{bash}
 QUEST_JL_EXPERT_BUILD=1
```

The value doesn't matter, the build process checks only *whether* the
environment variable is set or not.

If it is set, QuEST will be cloned from GitHub, but not built.  Only the `.h`-files will be taken to auto-generate the C-inferface.  You need to have your own compiled version of QuEST available, and you have to make Julia find it.

You need to make available for automatic loading two dynamically loaded libraries, with the names

* `libQuEST_32`  -- compiled with 32-bit precision
* `libQuEST_64`  -- compiled with 64-bit precision.

As in the non-expert version, once you create a QuEST environment with
a precision, the library is loaded, and Julia is bound to that
precision, until you stop Julia.

Note on Apple silicon (e.g., MacBook Air M1): If you use Julia in x86-mode (as it currently comes on Homebrew), you also have to build the QuEST library in x86-mode.  If you build it for ARM, Julia cannot load it across architectures.

## Documentation

In Julia:
* The module `QuEST_jl.QuEST`*xx* contains all functions (`createQureg()` and whatnot)
* The module `QuEST_jl.QuEST`*xx*`.QuEST_Types` contains all types (`Qureg` and whatnot)

We refer to QuEST for the documentation of all functions and types.


#### Difference from documented QuEST behavior

* `measureWithStats()`: instead of taking a reference to the probability, the Julia function
  returns a tuple (outcome,probability)

#### Julia-extensions to the QuEST interface

* Type `QuESTùë•ùë¶.QubitIdx` (exported): The element-type for arrays of qubits (a C-integer type)
